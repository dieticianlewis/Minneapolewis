[build]
  # Set your publish directory correctly (likely ".")
  publish = "."
  # Tell Netlify where the functions are
  functions = "netlify/functions"

[functions]
  # Ensure the Supabase library gets included with the function
  # You might need to adjust the path depending on your node_bundler
  # If using default zip-it-and-ship-it or esbuild, this might work:
  included_files = ["node_modules/@supabase/supabase-js/**"]
  # Or potentially: included_files = ["!node_modules/some-other-heavy-dep/**"]

# Optional redirects/headers...
